# DESCRIPTION:
The Number Guessing Game program in Java is an interactive console-based game designed to combine random number generation, user input handling, and control flow into a simple yet engaging activity. At the beginning, the program imports two essential libraries: java.util.Random to generate a random secret number, and java.util.Scanner to capture input from the user. Inside the main method, the game initializes some important variables such as the lower and upper bounds of the random number (1 to 100), the maximum number of attempts allowed (10), a counter for rounds won, and a boolean flag to control whether the user wants to continue playing multiple rounds. The game begins with a welcoming message and then enters a loop that repeats as long as the player chooses to continue. For each round, the program uses the Random class to generate a secret number between the defined bounds. The user is then informed about the range of numbers and the total number of attempts available. Within each round, the program uses another loop where the player makes guesses until they either guess the number correctly or exhaust their allotted attempts. Each guess is read through the Scanner object, and the program provides feedback: if the guess is lower than the secret number, it prints "Too low!", and if the guess is higher, it prints "Too high!". When the user guesses the correct number, the program congratulates them, displays the number of attempts taken, sets a flag indicating success, and increments the rounds won counter. One key aspect of the program is its input validation: if the user enters an invalid input (for example, a string instead of an integer), the program handles it gracefully using a try-catch block, displays a message about the invalid input, clears the buffer, and still counts it as one attempt. This prevents the program from crashing and ensures robust handling of unexpected inputs. If the user fails to guess the number within the maximum allowed attempts, the program reveals the secret number, thereby ensuring closure for that round. After each round, the program displays the total number of rounds won and then prompts the player with the option to play again by typing "yes" or "no". If the user enters "yes", the main game loop continues, generating a new random number for the next round; otherwise, the game ends by thanking the player and showing the final score in terms of total rounds won. The overall workflow is straightforward: initialize the game, generate a secret number, allow the user to guess with hints, track attempts and wins, handle invalid inputs, and finally ask whether to play again. This program highlights several important programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, exception handling, random number generation, and user interaction. In practical terms, it serves as a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to structure a Java application with user feedback and replayability. Moreover, by incorporating input validation and a scoring mechanism, the game moves beyond a simple guessing exercise and becomes a complete interactive experience that is enjoyable and logically sound.
